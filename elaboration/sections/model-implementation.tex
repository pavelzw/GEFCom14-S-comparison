\chapter{Model implementation}
\label{ch:model-implementation}

This chapter discusses the implementation of the 
aforementioned models. We firstly introduce the 
Python framework used in the implementation and go 
over the preprocessing steps that were used. 
Then we will look at each model separately and discuss the implementation 
of these models as well as the optimization of the hyperparameters.

The implementation of the models and the testing is done in Python. 
The source code can be found on 
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pavelzw/GEFCom14-S-comparison}}.
