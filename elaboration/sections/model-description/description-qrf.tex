\section{Quantile Regression Forests}
\label{sec:qrf}

Quantile Regression Forests were first proposed by \Textcite{Meinshausen2006}
and have since then proven to be a powerful method for high-dimensional quantile 
regression and time series forecasting. 
The method works in a similar way as Random Forest with the main difference 
being that we don't take the mean over the trees but take different quantiles 
from the trees.

The performance of this algorithm is very competitive in comparison with other 
linear and tree-based methods.
Therefore, they provide a competitive baseline for this thesis. 

\Textcite{Meinshausen2006} also shows that Quantile Regression Forests are consistent 
under some specific assumptions about the distribution of the covariates, the proportion of observations, the splitting criterion and the 
continuity and monotonicity of the \gls{cdf}.

Quantile Regression Forests work as follows (cf. \Textcite{Meinshausen2006}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grow \(k\) trees \(\func{T_1, \ldots, T_k}{\R^D}{\R}\) like in a Random Forest from the training data.
    \item For a given \(x\in\R^D\), calculate the outputs \( \tilde{y}_i = T_i(x) \) for all \(i \in \set{1, \ldots, k}\).
    \item Calculate the empirical quantiles \(y_{(0.01)}, \ldots, y_{(0.99)}\) from 
    \(\set{\tilde{y}_1, \ldots, \tilde{y}_k}\).
\end{enumerate}
