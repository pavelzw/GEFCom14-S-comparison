\section{Problem description}
\label{sec:problem-description}

This thesis tries to answer the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do nonparametric models perform in comparison to parametric models 
    on the probabilistic solar power generation forecasting problem?
    \item How do the models perform based on various aspects of forecast 
    quality?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How sharp is the forecast?
        \item Is the forecast calibrated?
        \item How large is the pinball loss?
        \item How large is the energy score?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Do the models behave as expected? If not, why is this the case?
    \item Are there drawbacks in the GEFCom2014 challenge?
\end{enumerate}
