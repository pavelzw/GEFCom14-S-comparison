\section{PIT Histograms}

In this section, we will look at the PIT histograms of the different forecasting models. 

Let \(F\) denote a CDF for an observation \(Y\). The probability integral 
transform (PIT) of \(F\) is the random variable \(Z_F = F(Y-) + V(F(Y) - F(Y-))\) 
where \(V \sim U(0,1)\). 
The probabiliy integral transform is the value that the predictive CDF 
attains at the observation \(Y\). 

If \(Y \sim F\) then \(Z_F\) is standard uniformly distributed. 
A forecast \(F\) is probabilistically calibrated if its PIT \(Z_F\) 
is uniformly distributed on the unit interval. 

A forecast is called overdispersed if \(\mathrm{var}(Z_F) > \frac{1}{12}\) or if 
the PIT histogram has a \(\cup\)-shape. A forecast is called underdispersed if 
\(\mathrm{var}(Z_F) < \frac{1}{12}\) or if the PIT histogram has a \(\cap\)-shape. 
Overdispersion indicate a too high estimated variance and underdispersion indicate 
that the variance of the forecast is too low.

Because the models act differently at each hour, it makes sense 
to look at the PIT histograms for each hour separately.

The PIT histograms broken down into each hour are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pit-qrf-by-hour}, Figure \ref{fig:pit-nnqf-by-hour}, 
Figure \ref{fig:pit-deepar-by-hour} and Figure \ref{fig:pit-sqf-rnn-by-hour}. \todo{maybe large images in appendix?}
The PIT histograms averaged over each hour are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pit}. 

One can observe that the PIT histogram of QRF (\ref{fig:pit-qrf}) and NNQF (\ref{fig:pit-nnqf}) are approximately 
\(U(0,1)\)-distributed but the forecasts during the night are overdispersed in the QRF case and 
skewed in the NNQF model.

The DeepAR and SQF-RNN model get similar results: they are both skewed with a high density at \(0\). 
This means that the actual output lies often in the lower quantiles of the prediction.
