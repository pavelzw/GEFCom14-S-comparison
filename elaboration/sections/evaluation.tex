\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:Evaluation}

In this chapter, we will look at the results of the different models. 
We first evaluate which features are most important for the models using 
permutation feature importance, then we will look at the pinball scores from 
that are used in the competition. Finally, we will look at how the models performed 
considering another scoring function, the Energy score.
