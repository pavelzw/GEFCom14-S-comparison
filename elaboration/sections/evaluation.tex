\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

In this chapter, we will look at the results of the different models. 
We first evaluate which features are most important for the models using 
permutation feature importance, then we will look at the pinball scores from 
that are used in the competition. Finally, we will look at how the models performed 
considering another scoring function, the Energy score as well as the probabilistic calibration 
of the models using PIT histograms.

Before we look at the different evaluation metrics, 
we take a quick look at what the models predicted. 
Figure \ref{fig:predictions} shows the \(0.1, 0.5\) and \(0.9\)-percentile 
of the predicted distribution as well as the actual target data.
We can observe that the predictions for the Quantile Random Forests in Figure \ref{fig:predictions-qrf} are 
capped at the top values.
