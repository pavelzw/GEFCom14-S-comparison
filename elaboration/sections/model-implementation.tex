From all predictors in Table \ref{table:predictors}, only SSRD, STRD, TSR, TP and TCC are used. 
Since the Variables SSRD, STRD and TSR are all available as accumulated fields, they first need to be decumulated.
This can be done by subtracting the value before the current value from the current value, for each day separately. 
Figure \ref{fig:strd-accumulated-vs-decumulated} shows both the accumulated and decumulated fields. 
A machine learning algorithm works better with the decumulated field since the decumulated field directly correlates 
with the power output of the solar plant.
