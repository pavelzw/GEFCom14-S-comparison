\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

This section covers related work concerning solar energy forecasting as well as 
the different models that we investigate. 
\Textcite{Hong2016} discuss the importance of solar energy, wind energy, electric load 
and electric price forecasting. They summarize the recent research progress on probabilistic 
energy forecasting and introduce the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014.
\Textcite{Meer2018} analyze the state of the art in probabilistic solar energy forecasting 
and assess different approaches in terms of performance. 
\Textcite{Hong2020} offer a view of the entire field of energy forecasting, summarize research 
trends and offer an outlook into the future of energy forecasting.
\Textcite{Meinshausen2006} proposes the Quantile Random Forests method. He describes 
how it works, gives numerical examples that underline its predictive performance
and provides proofs for some of the model's properties like consistency. 
\Textcite{Ordiano2019} introduce the Nearest Neighbors Quantile Filters (NNQF) method. 
They explain the advantages and test the model's performance on the GEFCom2014 dataset. 
We will also try out the model on the GEFCom2014 dataset and evaluate 
it in multiple kinds of manners.
\Textcite{Salinas2017} introduce the DeepAR model -- a model for probabilistic forecasting 
with autoregressive recurrent neural networks. They evaluate the model on several 
real-world data sets and show that this model has accuracy improvements of around 
\(15\%\) compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
\Textcite{Gasthaus2019} propose the SQF-RNN model, an extension of the DeepAR model 
that is supposed to be a more flexible method for probabilistic forecasting 
by modeling the quantile function with splines instead of a fixed distribution class.
They empirically demonstrate its effectiveness by evaluating the model on several real-world 
data sets and comparing it with the DeepAR model.

In this thesis, we compare these models and discuss 
their suitability for solar power generation forecasting.
