\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem-description}

This thesis tries to address the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do nonparametric models perform in comparison to parametric models 
    on the probabilistic solar power generation forecasting problem?
    \item How do the models perform based on various aspects of forecast 
    quality? Are the forecasts sharp and calibrated? How large are the variances and losses?
    \item Are there challenges and advantages of the chosen GEFCom2014 competition setup?
\end{enumerate}
