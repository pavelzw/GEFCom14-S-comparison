\stress{\textbf{Disclaimer to this document:} 
This is a template with some additional thesis information and a sample structure. 
The structure includes the chapters most commonly needed in a thesis. 
Neither the order nor the chapter titles are fixed and will most likely 
have to be adapted to your specific thesis. 
However, the notes here should help you to get an idea what each chapter 
could be about and how to use this template. 
When in doubt, please talk to your supervisor(s).}

Your thesis should start with an introduction. The introduction is supposed to motivate your thesis.
Discuss the relevance of your topic, why are you looking into it, why is it relevant in the field? Cite important research related to your motivation.
Briefly state the problem as in the abstract and repeat the contribution, for example in the form of research questions. 

Give an outline of your thesis.
