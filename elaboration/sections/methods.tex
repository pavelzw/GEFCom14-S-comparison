\chapter{Methodology/ Foundations}
\label{ch:methods}

This chapter should introduce to the theoretical background of your thesis. Any method abd concept you use to obtain the results, should be introduced and explained. Additionally, you should describe how you evaluate/ solve/ approach the research question which you are answering in your thesis. Depending on your thesis topic and structure, foundations and methodology can both be part of one chapter, or separated into two different chapters. If you are unsure what to do, or what the differences are, please contact your supervisor.

\section{Method 1}

This is an example for a simple equation without equation numbering.
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}
$$

You can also use equation numbering if you need to refer to an equation later \eg \Cref{eq:ex1}.


\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{eq:ex1}
\end{equation}

Additionally, simple equations can be put inline with the text, for example, $x \in X$. Remember to set all variables in math font \ie all $x$, $i$ and so on.

\section{Method 2}
