  month         = {mar},
  abstract      = {Parametric quantile regressions are a useful tool for creating probabilistic energy forecasts. Nonetheless, since classical quantile regressions are trained using a non-differentiable cost function, their creation using complex data mining techniques (e.g., artificial neural networks) may be complicated. This article presents a method that uses a new nearest neighbors quantile filter to obtain quantile regressions independently of the utilized data mining technique and without the non-differentiable cost function. Thereafter, a validation of the presented method using the dataset of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition of 2014 is undertaken. The results show that the presented method is able to solve the competition's task with a similar accuracy and in a similar time as the competition's winner, but requiring a much less powerful computer. This property may be relevant in an online forecasting service for which the fast computation of probabilistic forecasts using not so powerful machines is required.},

  title    = {Probabilistic Forecasting with Spline Quantile Function RNNs},
  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a flexible method for probabilistic modeling with conditional quantile functions using monotonic regression splines. The shape of the spline is parameterized by a neural network whose parameters are learned by minimizing the continuous ranked probability score. Within this framework, we propose a method for probabilistic time series forecasting, which combines the modeling capacity of recurrent neural networks with the flexibility of a spline-based representation of the output distribution. Unlike methods based on parametric probability density functions and maximum likelihood estimation, the proposed method can flexibly adapt to different output distributions without manual intervention. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on synthetic and real-world data sets.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this work is to produce probabilistic forecasts of solar power for the Global
Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014). The task involves predicting the
outputs from three solar farms at an hourly resolution using data from the ECMWF
numerical weather prediction model.
The annual cycle of solar radiation and power is modelled using a low-pass filter built
using a Fourier transformation. The diurnal cycle is handled by fitting separate models for
each hour of the day with the positive solar radiation. A model for simulating PV power
production, taking the effect of temperature into account, is also included.
The forecasting methods were gradient boosting for the deterministic forecasting of
solar power and k-nearest neighbors regression for estimating prediction intervals in
order to provide probabilistic forecasts. A cross-validation strategy, splitting the data into
monthly folds, was employed for comparing the performances of alternative methods and
in an attempt to avoid overfitting issues.},

the application of the method to several tracks in the 2014 Global Energy Forecasting
Competition (GEFCom2014). The proposed method uses a multiple quantile regression
approach to predict a full distribution over possible future energy outcomes, uses the
alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problems resulting
from this quantile regression formulation efficiently, and uses a radial basis function
network to capture the non-linear dependencies on the input data. For the GEFCom2014
competition, the approach proved general enough to obtain one of the top five ranks in
three tracks, solar, wind, and price forecasting, and it was also ranked seventh in the final
load forecasting track.},

  month         = {feb},
  abstract      = {Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.},
