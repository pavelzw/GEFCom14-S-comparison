\section{Energy score}

The energy score is a proper scoring rule that is used for 
evaluating multi dimensional forecasts. A time series \((y_t)_t\) 
can be evaluated in this fashion by looking at a sequence of \(H\) 
points, i.e. \((y_t, \ldots, y_{t-H+1})_t \in \R^H\). 
The scoring rule is defined as follows:
\[ \mathrm{S}(P, y) = \mathbb{E}_P ||Y-y||_2 - \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_P ||Y-Y'||_2, \]
where \(Y'\) is an i.i.d. copy of \(Y\), so it is drawn independently with the same distribution \(P\).

This scoring rule takes the time series attributes, namely the 
correlation of adjacent data points, into account while 
the pinball loss only evaluates the score pointwise.

The results of the energy score are shown in Figure \ref{fig:energy-score}.
