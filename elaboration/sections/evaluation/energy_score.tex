\section{Energy Score}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:energy-score-explanation}, the energy score is used to 
evaluate multivariate data and can be used to put 
the time series attributes of a forecast into account in comparison to the pinball loss.

The results of the energy score are shown in Figure \ref{fig:energy-score}. 
We can observe that the SQF-RNN model performs better than or at least similar 
to the NNQF and QRF models in every month with July and August as exception. 
Another thing to note is that the DeepAR model always performs worse than the SQF-RNN model.

QRF returns a mean score of \(0.36759\), NNQF a mean score of \(0.36736\), 
SQF-RNN a mean score of \(0.36644\) and DeepAR a mean score of \(0.44235\).
