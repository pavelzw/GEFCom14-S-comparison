  abstract      = {Parametric quantile regressions are a useful tool for creating probabilistic energy forecasts. Nonetheless, since classical quantile regressions are trained using a non-differentiable cost function, their creation using complex data mining techniques (e.g., artificial neural networks) may be complicated. This article presents a method that uses a new nearest neighbors quantile filter to obtain quantile regressions independently of the utilized data mining technique and without the non-differentiable cost function. Thereafter, a validation of the presented method using the dataset of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition of 2014 is undertaken. The results show that the presented method is able to solve the competition's task with a similar accuracy and in a similar time as the competition's winner, but requiring a much less powerful computer. This property may be relevant in an online forecasting service for which the fast computation of probabilistic forecasts using not so powerful machines is required.},

  a neural network whose parameters are learned by minimizing the continuous ranked probability score. 
  Within this framework, we propose a method for probabilistic time series forecasting, which combines 
  the modeling capacity of recurrent neural networks with the flexibility of a spline-based representation 
  of the output distribution. Unlike methods based on parametric probability density functions 
  and maximum likelihood estimation, the proposed method can flexibly adapt to different output distributions

  outputs from three solar farms at an hourly resolution using data from the ECMWF
  numerical weather prediction model.
  The annual cycle of solar radiation and power is modelled using a low-pass filter built
  using a Fourier transformation. The diurnal cycle is handled by fitting separate models for
  each hour of the day with the positive solar radiation. A model for simulating PV power
  production, taking the effect of temperature into account, is also included.
  The forecasting methods were gradient boosting for the deterministic forecasting of
  solar power and k-nearest neighbors regression for estimating prediction intervals in
  order to provide probabilistic forecasts. A cross-validation strategy, splitting the data into
  monthly folds, was employed for comparing the performances of alternative methods and
  in an attempt to avoid overfitting issues.},

  abstract      = {Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.},

In this paper we propose DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto regressive recurrent network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how by applying deep learning techniques to forecasting, one can overcome many of the challenges faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. We show through extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world forecasting data sets accuracy improvements of around 15\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  since proven to be very popular and powerful for high-dimensional regression and classification. For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional
  mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information
  about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a
  generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and
  accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables.
  The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm
  is competitive in terms of predictive power.},

Due to their importance, the number and complexity of tools and methods used for time series analysis is constantly increasing. However, due to unclear APIs and a lack of documentation, researchers struggle to integrate them into their research projects and replicate results. Additionally, in time series analysis there exist many repetitive tasks, which are often re-implemented for each project, unnecessarily costing time. To solve these problems we present \texttt{pyWATTS}, an open-source Python-based package that is a non-sequential workflow automation tool for the analysis of time series data. pyWATTS includes modules with clearly defined interfaces to enable seamless integration of new or existing methods, subpipelining to easily reproduce repetitive tasks, load and save functionality to simply replicate results, and native support for key Python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Keras.},
