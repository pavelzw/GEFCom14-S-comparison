In this chapter, we give motivation why the models were selected and 
describe their basic functionality as well as their advantages.

Quantile Random Forests have proven to be a very competitive 
and powerful quantile regression method for high-dimensional datasets. 
This is the reason why we use it as a benchmark to compare the other two models 
against it.
Nearest Neighbor Quantile Regression is the method utilized by the first place 
in the GEFCom14 challenge. NNQF uses a similar strategy but requires much less 
computation power in order to predict its output. 
SQF-RNN uses autoregressive input with an RNN structure and provides flexible 
conditional output distributions through spline quantile functions. 
\Textcite{Gasthaus2019} already shows that it works well on large solar energy 
forecasting datasets.

In order to describe the model in the following subsections, we will introduce the necessary notation here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(n\) is the training data length
    \item \(x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \R^D\) are the predictor values of the time series
    \item \(y_1, \ldots, y_n \in \R\) are the corresponding target values
\end{itemize}
