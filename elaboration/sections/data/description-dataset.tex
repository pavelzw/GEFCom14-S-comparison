\section{The GEFCom2014 dataset}

In order to compare different energy forecasting methods, 
\Textcite{Hong2016} organized the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014), 
a probabilistic energy forecasting competition with four tracks: 
electric load, electric prica, wind power and solar power forecasting. 
The competition attracted 581 participants from 61 countries. 

The Global Energy Forecasting Competition took place the first time in 2012. 
In the 2014 competition, they upgraded the competition with three features: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item instead of point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts were used;
    \item four forecasting tracks were used: electric load (L track), 
    electric price (P track), wind power (W track) and solar power (S track);
    electric load an wind forecasting were also used in 2012, solar power and 
    electric price forecasting were added;
    \item incremental data releases on a weekly basis to mimic real world forecasting.
\end{enumerate}

In this thesis, we will only look at the solar power track. 
In this track, you need to predict the power generation of three 
solar power plants (the so called zones) in Australia. 
The prediction should be on a rolling basis for 24 h ahead. 
For the forecasts, you get different prediction variables shown in Table 1.

\subsection{Error measure}

To evaluate the different forecast competitors in GEFCom2014, 
the pinball loss was used -- mainly because of the ease of implementation 
and because the pinball loss is a proper scoring rule\footnote{see \ref{sec:proper-scoring-rules}}. \todo{footnote or link?}
For each time period over the forecast horizon, the participants need to 
provide the quantiles \(q_{0.01}, \ldots, q_{0.99}\). 
\(q_0 = -\infty\) and \(q_1 = \infty\) are the natural lower and upper bounds. 
Those quantiles are then evaluated with the pinball loss (\ref{sec:pinball-loss}).

The overall score is the average over all time points, zones and quantiles.
The models are then compared with a benchmark which is a basic point forecast 
that was created using a na\"{i}ve model.
