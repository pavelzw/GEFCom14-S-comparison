\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

In this chapter, we look at the results of the different models. 
We first evaluate which features are most important for the models using 
permutation feature importance, then we look at the pinball losses 
that are used in the competition. Finally, we assess how the models performed 
considering another scoring function, the Energy score, as well as the probabilistic calibration 
of the models using PIT histograms.

Before we focus on the different evaluation metrics, 
we take a quick look at what the models predicted. 
Figure \ref{fig:predictions} shows the \(0.1, 0.5\) and \(0.9\)-percentile 
of the predicted distribution as well as the actual target data.
We can observe that the predictions for the Quantile Random Forests in Figure \ref{fig:predictions-qrf} are 
capped at the top values.
