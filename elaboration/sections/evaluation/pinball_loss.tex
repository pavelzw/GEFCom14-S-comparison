\section{Pinball loss}
\label{sec:elaboration-pinball-loss}

As stated in section \ref{sec:gefcom-dataset}, the pinball loss is 
used to determine the performance of the different models. 
It is calculated by taking the average over all pinball losses for each time 
point and zone in the dataset. 

Table \ref{table:pinball-loss} and Figure \ref{fig:pinball-loss} show the 
losses of the models for task 4 to task 15 (July 2013 to June 2014). 
We can see that the QRF and NNQF model perform similarly and that the 
SQF-RNN model performs better that the other two during the months from October to Febuary.
Another thing to note is that the DeepAR model always performs worse than the SQF-RNN model.
