\section{Hyperparameter tuning}

Since all models share a similar environment, the 
hyperparameter optimization can be done similar for every model.
They are tuned using the 
hyperopt package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt}}.

In order to use it, we need to set up a space of 
all parameters that we want to optimize and 
then call the \texttt{fmin} method to minimize the loss 
calculated by the pyWATTS pipeline. 
The algorithm to select the next set of hyperparameters is 
the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator approach (TPE) 
that is described by \Textcite{Bergstra2011}.
