\chapter{Model implementation}
\label{ch:model-implementation}

In order to test the performance of the different models on the GEFCom14-S dataset, we need to implement them. 
The implementation is done in Python and can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pavelzw/GEFCom14-S-comparison}}.

From all predictors in Table \ref{table:predictors}, only SSRD, STRD, TSR, TP and TCC are used. 
Since the Variables SSRD, STRD and TSR are all available as accumulated fields, they first need to be decumulated.
This can be done by subtracting the value before the current value from the current value, for each day separately. 
Figure \ref{fig:strd-accumulated-vs-decumulated} shows both the accumulated and decumulated fields. 
A machine learning algorithm works better with the decumulated field since the decumulated field directly correlates 
with the power output of the solar plant.

    In order to get the actual data, we first need to subtract the previous point \(x_{t-1}\) from \(x_t\).}%

Since we are using some steps like the calculation of the pinball loss multiple times, 
it makes sense to use some kind of pipeline structure for the code. 
\Textcite{Heidrich2021} introduced 
pyWATTS\footnote{\url{https://github.com/KIT-IAI/pyWATTS}}: a framework 
that is designed to solve the issue of creating pipelines for time series 
forecasting.
