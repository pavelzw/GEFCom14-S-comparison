  abstract      = {Parametric quantile regressions are a useful tool for creating probabilistic energy forecasts. Nonetheless, since classical quantile regressions are trained using a non-differentiable cost function, their creation using complex data mining techniques (e.g., artificial neural networks) may be complicated. This article presents a method that uses a new nearest neighbors quantile filter to obtain quantile regressions independently of the utilized data mining technique and without the non-differentiable cost function. Thereafter, a validation of the presented method using the dataset of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition of 2014 is undertaken. The results show that the presented method is able to solve the competition's task with a similar accuracy and in a similar time as the competition's winner, but requiring a much less powerful computer. This property may be relevant in an online forecasting service for which the fast computation of probabilistic forecasts using not so powerful machines is required.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we propose a flexible method for probabilistic modeling with conditional 
  quantile functions using monotonic regression splines. The shape of the spline is parameterized by 
  a neural network whose parameters are learned by minimizing the continuous ranked probability score. 
  Within this framework, we propose a method for probabilistic time series forecasting, which combines 
  the modeling capacity of recurrent neural networks with the flexibility of a spline-based representation 
  of the output distribution. Unlike methods based on parametric probability density functions 
  and maximum likelihood estimation, the proposed method can flexibly adapt to different output distributions 
  without manual intervention. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness 
  of the approach on synthetic and real-world data sets.},

  abstract      = {Probabilistic forecasting, i.e. estimating the probability distribution of a time series' future given its past, is a key enabler for optimizing business processes. In retail businesses, for example, forecasting demand is crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time at the right place. In this paper we propose DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto regressive recurrent network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how by applying deep learning techniques to forecasting, one can overcome many of the challenges faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. We show through extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world forecasting data sets accuracy improvements of around 15\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Random forests were introduced as a machine learning tool in Breiman (2001) and have
  since proven to be very popular and powerful for high-dimensional regression and classification. For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional
  mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information
  about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a
  generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and
  accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables.
  The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm
  is competitive in terms of predictive power.},
