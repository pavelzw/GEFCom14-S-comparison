\section{SQF-RNN}
\label{sec:implementation-sqf-rnn}

The implementation for the SQF-RNN model can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts}}.

\Textcite{Salinas2017} proposed DeepAR which is also a 
probabilistic forecasting model with RNNs. It outputs the 
parameters of a probabilistic distribution as the forecast. 
The disadvantage of this method is that it requires the 
specification of the probabilistic distribution that fits the data. 
For complex problems, this is often not trivial. 
In the DeepAR implementation, the Student's \(t\)-distribution is used. 
This method performs noticably worse on the GEFCom14 dataset. 

The CRPS is often used to evaluate a forecast model but its usage as 
a direct loss function in the training process is rare. 
As the CRPS is closely related to the pinball loss\footnote{see \ref{ch:crps}}, 
this helps in the GEFCom14 problem since it directly minimizes the given metric.
