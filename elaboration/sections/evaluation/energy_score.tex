\section{Energy Score}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:energy-score-explanation}, the energy score is used to 
evaluate multivariate probabilistic forecasts and can be used to take 
the time series attributes of a forecast into account in contrast to the pinball loss.

The results of the energy score are shown in Figure \ref{fig:energy-score}. 
We can observe that the SQF-RNN model performs better than or at least similar 
to the NNQF and QRF models in every month except for July and August. 
Another thing to note is that the DeepAR model always performs worse than the SQF-RNN model.

QRF returns a mean score of \(0.368\), NNQF a mean score of \(0.367\), 
SQF-RNN a mean score of \(0.366\) and DeepAR a mean score of \(0.442\).
