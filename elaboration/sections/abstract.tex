		As the share of electricity from regenerative sources is growing constantly, the weather becomes an increasingly important factor in the analysis of electricity markets. Hence, this thesis uses local weather data to predict electricity spot prices. More precisely, we include wind speed and temperature from individual German weather stations into time series and statistical learning models. However, as the available weather information is vast and renewable power is not generated everywhere, we use random forests and Bayesian structural time series to perform a feature selection. Overall, we manage to improve our forecasting accuracy of the EPEX electricity prices by up to \SI{7.69}{\percent} in terms of root mean squared error and up to \SI{8.19}{\percent} in terms of mean absolute error.
