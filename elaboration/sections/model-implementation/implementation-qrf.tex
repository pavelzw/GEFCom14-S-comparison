\section{Quantile Regression Forests}
\label{sec:implementation-qrf}

A Python implementation for Quantile Regression Forests can 
be found in the doubt\footnote{\url{https://github.com/saattrupdan/doubt}} package.

The preprocessing of the data is the same as in the SQF-RNN model. 

The number of trees in the forest is set to \(100\), 
the splitting criterion is the mean squared error, 
the maximum depth of the tree is set to \(\infty\) and the maximum number 
of leaves is set to \(32\).

After training and prediction, the results are again evaluated 
using the pinball loss scoring rule.

The hyperparameters of Quantile Regression Forests are very similar to the ones 
of conventional Random Forests. We can choose the number of trees in the forest, 
the splitting criterion (mean squared error or mean absolute error), 
the splitting strategy (best split or best random split) 
and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. 
We can also change the shape of the trees: 
the maximum depth, minimum number of samples required to split a node, the minimum number of samples per leaf and 
the maximum number of leaf nodes can all be adjusted.
The parameters after tuning are shown in Table \ref{table:qrf-hyperparameters}.
\todo{How were the hyperparameters tuned?}
