\section{Quantile Regression Forests}
\label{sec:implementation-qrf}

A Python implementation for Quantile Regression Forests can 
be found in the doubt\footnote{\url{https://github.com/saattrupdan/doubt}} package.

The preprocessing of the data is the same as in the SQF-RNN model. 

The number of trees in the forest is set to \(100\), 
the splitting criterion is the mean squared error, 
the maximum depth of the tree is set to \(\infty\) and the maximum number 
of leaves is set to \(32\).

After training and prediction, the results are again evaluated 
using the pinball loss scoring rule.
