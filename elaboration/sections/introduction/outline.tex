\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

This thesis has the following structure. 
First, I present the GEFCom2014 dataset that we are working with. 
Subsequently, we look at each of the models in more detail. 
Then, I describe how the models are implemented as well as 
the hyperparameter optimization.
Afterwards, we evaluate the results by looking at the 
most important features, the losses for each month as well as 
the PIT histograms for the predictions. 
Finally, we discuss the results and draw a conclusion for this thesis.
