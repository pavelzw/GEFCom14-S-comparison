\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

The rest of this thesis is structured as follows.
First, we present the GEFCom2014 dataset used for the evaluation. 
Subsequently, we look at each of the models in more detail. 
Then, we describe how the models are implemented as well as 
the hyperparameter optimization.
Afterwards, we evaluate the results by looking at the 
most important features, the losses for each month as well as 
the PIT histograms for the predictions. 
Finally, we discuss the results and draw a conclusion for this thesis.
